## 1. Look over the dataset
It looks as though this data mostly focuses on insurance charges, paired with very basic health data like age, BMI, and smoker status.

    Columns: age, sex, bmi, children, smoker, region, charges

## 2. Scope/Goal
What I plan to look at.
    1. Average insurance cost of smokers vs. non-smokers.
    2. Average insurance cost of high(>25) vs low(<25) BMI.
    3. Average insurance cost of Male vs Female.
    4. Average insurance cost per region.
    4. Is BMI have any relation to smoking status?
    

    ### GOAL
    Find the different contributing factors, such as BMI, somking, sex, or even region, to the high cost of charges to insurance.
