# US_Medical_insurance

### Summary
This data took me a few hours to explore. I used pandas to help explore and manipulate the data. A good portion of my time ~20% was used making and writing summeries. Writing summeries was something I wanted to focus on to build that skill. Writing in this ReadMe was another of my learning goals. I want to be able to explain what I am doing on this and future projects.

## 1. Look over the dataset
It looks as though this data mostly focuses on insurance charges, paired with very basic health data like age, BMI, and smoker status.

    Columns: age, sex, bmi, children, smoker, region, charges

## 2. Scope/Goal
#### Scope:
1. Average insurance cost of smokers vs. non-smokers.
2. Average insurance cost of high(>25) vs low(<25) BMI.
3. Is BMI have any relation to smoking status?
    

### GOAL
Find the different contributing factors, such as BMI, somking, sex, or even region, to the high cost of charges to insurance. 

## 3. Step by Step
1. Import needed libraries: panda & numpy
2. Import insurance.csv with pandas into a pandas dataframe.
3. Take a quick look at the data, formating, and columns
4. Do I need to clean the data in any way?
5. Plan out what I am going to do(Scope/Goal) and what functions I need to accomplish this
6. Start working in Jupyter notebook
    -Added section 1. Smokers vs. non-smokers. 
    -Added section 2. BMI high vs. low
7. Decided I don't have enough data, going back to add in needed info
8. Finished Smokers/Non-smokers
9. Finished BMI
10. Added and finished Smoking to BMI relation
11. Writing conclusions
