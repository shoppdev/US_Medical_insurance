2. Import insurance.csv with pandas into a pandas dataframe.
3. Take a quick look at the data, formating, and columns
4. Do I need to clean the data in any way?
5. Plan out what I am going to do(Scope/Goal) and what functions I need to accomplish this
6. Start working in Jupyter notebook
    -Added section 1. Smokers vs. non-smokers. 
    -Added section 2. BMI high vs. low
